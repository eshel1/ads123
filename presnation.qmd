## research question :

the relations between car sharing services and the economic status of users

## INTRODUCTION and Methodology:

Traffic congestion is a 'global' issue, and people that are wealthier often own their cars, the middle class may use car-sharing services to save money.

Our research hypothesis will chekt the connection between the usage of car-sharing services and socio-economic status In Tel Aviv. the Auto Tel program is an example of car sharing service,The Auto Tel service, operated by the city of Tel Aviv, provides car-sharing services to its residents

In this research, we aim to determine whether this hypothesis is true. We collected data on individuals drives using Auto Tel sharing cars data , including their geographic coordinates. we aggregated the data to statistical zones by performing a spatial , we linked this data to socio-economic status indicators. Our goal int this woel is to analyze the relatishon between economic status and the usage patterns of the Auto Tel car-sharing program.

## Literature1:

#### Car-sharing services: An annotated review

| Car sharing services offer flexibility of private mobility without the need for individual vehicle ownership, thus its transforming mobility into a public service. This new form of transportation is increasing mobility for users.
|  It also can raise awareness of the social and environmental impacts of private car usage and supports multi-modal transportation- allowing people to combine different ways of travel such as trains, buses, and private cars in a single trip.
| the three kin of a sharing car services :
| 
| **• tow way** The cars are parked at parking lots that are defined by the service provider or the local administration and the trips must start and end at the same place.
| 
| • **one way** -The parking lot where the trip ends can be different from the parking lot where it started. The variety of parking lots is predefined by the operator.
| **• free floating**: in this method cars are parked freely in public spaces within the operational area the trip can start and end at any point in this area.
| 
| Car sharing companies must consider strategic and econoomic sdecisions when planning the service that affect the users; such as defining fleet size, location of facilities, boundaries of urban areas service, and managing the local demand.
| it reavels that car-sharing services are more popular in high-density neighborhoods, where public transportation is more efficient and private car use is less frequent. this suggest the sharing car ar parth of the public transportation services

#### Human mobility and socioeconomic status: Analysis of Singapore and Boston

-   the study cheks the relation between socio-economic status and mobility and accessibility, zooming on the mobility of populations and the influence of regional ecomnis

-   the movement patterns, considering the spatial extent of the individual's activity space, the frequency of daily mobility, the variety of movements between important activity locations.

-   The stufy hypothesis is that human patterns are related to their regional socio-economic characteristics such as per capita income and poverty rate.

-   the level of mobility is esamden through the spatial scope of a person's activity space- how regularly their mobility is on daily basis , the variety of movements between important activity locations, and the unity of mobility traces.

-   The study uses two types of socioeconomic data - housing prices in Singapore and per capita income in Boston. Wealthier user groups tend to travel shorter distances in Singapore, while in Boston they travel farther. Other mobility indicators, such as the number of activity locations, activity and travel variety, show similar characteristics in different socioeconomic classes.

-   The conflicting findings of the artical on two cities shows a complected relation between travel distance and wealth. These differences are orginate in the spatial arrangement of cities themselves , but this is no part of ouerk work and previsosly oin vastgeye This can largely explain the spatial shape of cities in the United States, where wealthier people live in the suburbs and more disadvantaged people occupy city centers. Although this arrangement is changing,

-   the Results suggest that the level of wealth, in Singapore and Boston, is not a factor in how people move around the city. The analysis shows that the relation between mobility and socio-economic development is diffrent between cities, and that indicators of mobility may not be effective in certain types of cities.

#### Does Car Sharing Contribute to Urban Sustainability from User-Motivation Perspectives?

-   The world is facing many challenges in sustainable are world wide, especially with the need for economic development amid climate change and over population cities in urban areas. In recent years , people have been looking for technologies that provide better service access, leading to the quick rise of the sharing economy.

-   The sharing economy in this way is a way to reduce the environmental impact and costs of products and increase the availability of means of transportation. This narrow perception makes it possible to take advantage of used resources. that brought an breakthrough in the field of transportation. Car sharing is a part of the 'sharing economy 'that gets people use cars when needed without having to buy one.

-   study surrounding the motivation of people to use shared vehicles, they found that economic benefits are the most influential in a user's choice to use a car sharing service. that car sharing can be considered as an alternative viable mobility solution, and that the economic benefits are the strongest motivating factors for using car sharing services.

## Literature4:

## Indices for testing the hypothesis:

The articles provide a scientific background for us to assume that there is a connection between economic status and the use of shared vehicles. To analyze this assumption, we used: - **carto_pop**: Using in sharing cars divided by population - **age_y_pec**: Young people percentage in population - **age_a_pec**: Adult people percentage in population - **Vehicle2up_pcnt**: Percentage of households with two or more vehicles. - **SelfEmployedAnnual_medWage**: Median annual wage for self-employed individuals. - **Parking_pcnt**: Percentage of households with parking facilities. - **AcadmCert_pcnt**: Percentage of the population with an academic certificate. - **SelfEmployedAnnual_medWage**: Median annual wage for self-employed individuals. - **Economics_Index**: Social economic index from LAMS tables

```

Using the corrgram function, we can see that there is a weak to strong correlation between the variables, that is showing the linearity of their relationshions.thers multicollinearity for the variables, asspecialy yeesAnnual_med, Parking_pcnt, AcadmCert_pcnt, and employedAnnual_me. This means these variables are strongly correlated with each other and not only with a single variable. In this cases, the model can be used for prediction but not suitable for measuring the individual influence of these variables due to independence of observations.

## linear regression model

```{r,echo=TRUE}
lm1=lm(carto_pop  ~  +age_y_pec+age_a_pec+Vehicle2up_pcnt+
employeesAnnual_medWage+Parking_pcnt+AcadmCert_pcnt+Economics_Index , data = final_data)
summary(lm1)

```

There are 178 observations in the dataset (170 degrees of freedom with 7 predictors). The linear regression model is showing that none of the predictor variables have a significant effect on crar sharing, as all **p-values** are above **0.05**. The model explains **1.68%** carto_pop (Multiple **R-squared**: **0.0168**, Adjusted R-squared: -0.02368), indicating a **poor fit.**

there are statistically significant correlations between carto_pop and some individual variables, the linear regression model does not explain much of the data. Despite these significant correlations, the linear regression model has a low R-squared value (0.0168) and non-significant p-values for the predictors, indicating that the model explains only a small fraction of the variance This discrepancy is likely due to multicollinearity, where high correlations among predictors.

## Conclusions

We can conclude that there is no a sidnifcen relation between car sharing services usage and economics status.None of the indicators predict high usage of car sharing service , It means there is no connection them.Future studies can continue investigating with more data to find the reasom of the relation between the field that we studied of economics and transportation.
